🚀 Project Requirements
Buliding the Data Warehouse 
📘 Objective

Build a Modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, implementing ETL processes, data modeling, and data analytics to enable efficient business insights.

🧩 Project Specifications
🗂️ Data Sources

Import and integrate data from two source systems — ERP and CRM — both provided as CSV files.

🧼 Data Quality & Cleansing

Detect, cleanse, and resolve data quality issues such as duplicates, nulls, and inconsistencies.

Ensure data integrity and accuracy before loading into the warehouse.

🔗 Data Integration & Modeling

Combine ERP and CRM datasets into a single, unified data model.

Design a user-friendly schema to support efficient querying and reporting.

📅 Scope

Focus on the latest dataset only for analysis and insights.

📝 Documentation

Provide clear and concise documentation of the data model.

Make it understandable for business stakeholders and analytics teams.

⚙️ Tech Stack

SQL Server (Data Warehouse & ETL)

SQL (Data Transformation & Analytics)

Excel / Power BI (Optional for visualization)

CSV Files (Source Data)

📊 Deliverables

✅ Data Warehouse schema (Star/Snowflake Model)

✅ ETL Scripts (Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

✅ Cleaned and integrated data tables

✅ Documentation for stakeholders and analysts

💡 Outcome

A centralized, clean, and analytics-ready Data Warehouse that empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Would you like me to make it in a GitHub-styled format with emojis and markdown badges (like ![SQL](...) and sections with collapsible details)? It’ll look even more professional for your repository.
